# Introduction

This workshop walks you through deploying Logging Analytics Kubernetes Monitoring Solution for Oracle OKE cluster. This monitoring solution is based on FluentD based Kubernetes Daemonset and Replica Sets for collecting Kubernetes platform logs, pods logs, and node logs. It also collects Kubernetes Object details on periodic basis. This workshop uses Oracle OKE for deployment for simplicity, but it can be similarly deployed for any Kubernetes environment.
